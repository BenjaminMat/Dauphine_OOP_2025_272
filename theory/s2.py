## Encapsulation in Python - Part 2

    Encapsulation is a core concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It refers to restricting access to
    certain details of an object and only exposing what is necessary for the outside world to interact with. 
    Essentially, it involves bundling the data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on the data 
    into a single unit, or class, and controlling the access to that data. Encapsulation helps to safeguard the 
    internal state of the object and protects it from unauthorized direct access and modification.

    **Definition/Concept: Public and Private attributes in Python:**
        Unlike languages like Java or C++, Python does not have a strict mechanism to define attributes or methods
        as "private" or "public." Instead, Python follows a naming convention to indicate the developer's intention
        regarding the usage of attributes and methods.

        *Public Attributes and Methods:**

        *"Private" Attributes and Methods (by convention):**

        *Name Mangling for Attributes and Methods:**

    **Why & When to use it:**

## Inheritance in Python - Reminder

    ** Definition/Concept ** 
        Inheritance is a pillar of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It allows a class to inherit features 
        (methods and properties) from another class. The class being inherited from is known as the parent class, 
        superclass or base class, and the class that inherits is known as the child class, subclass or derived class.

## Multiple Inheritance in Python

    **Definition/Concept:**
        Python supports multiple inheritance, which means that a class can inherit from multiple parent classes.
        This allows a derived class to combine functionalities from several base classes.

    ** Syntax of Multiple Inheritance:**
        Python uses a straightforward syntax to define multiple inheritance by listing all parent classes
        in the parentheses after the class name.

    **Practical Benefits of Multiple Inheritance:**

    **Method Resolution Order (MRO) in Detail**
        The Method Resolution Order (MRO) is crucial for understanding how Python handles inheritance, especially 
        multiple inheritance.

        The MRO defines the order in which Python searches for methods and attributes in a class hierarchy.

        This is particularly important in multiple inheritance scenarios where multiple parent classes may define 
        the same method.
"""

# Visualizing MRO:
# You can visualize the MRO of a class using the mro() method or the __mro__ attribute:
print(DerivedClass.mro())
print(DerivedClass.__mro__)

# Detailed Example of Method Resolution:
class A:
    def method(self):
        print("Method in A")


class B(A):
    def method(self):

# 4.1 Definition and Utility:

# Purpose of super():

# - Extending the behavior of a parent method without completely rewriting it.
# - Ensuring proper management of multiple inheritance.

class F:
    def method(self):

** Dunder methods**

## 1 - Overall definition
    **Definition/Concept**
        "Dunder" is short for "Double underscore" (__). Dunder methods are a set of predefined methods you can use to 
        enrich your classes in Python. You've already seen these special methods in previous class with the
        `__init__` method

    **Why**
        
   **When to use it**
       

You can find a list of dunder methods in the additional resources directory 

## 2 - Use built-in functions for classes by implementing dunder methods

    **Definition/Concept**
        The dunder method for specifying the behavior of built-in Python functions like `len` or `str` involves 
        implementing specific, predefined methods within your class using double underscores (__). 
        Such methods include `__len__`, `__str__`, and others, which Python calls when built-in functions of the same 
        name are used on instances of your class.

## 3.2.2 - The __repr__() Method
    **Definition/Concept**:
        The `__repr__()` method in Python is a dunder method associated with a class.  
        It should return a string that looks like a valid Python expression and could be used to recreate an object with 
        the same properties.  Ideally, using `eval(repr(obj))` should produce an object equivalent to `obj`.

    **Why**:
       
    **When to use it**:
        
    Benefits of __repr__() when implementing complex Python framework:
        Traceability: In complex financial simulations or optimizations, you might be dealing with hundreds of 
                    instrument objects. If something goes wrong, having a clear __repr__() output can help you trace 
                    back to the exact instrument causing the issue.

        Reproducibility: Sometimes you may need to send the state of your system (the exact instruments and their 
                    properties) to someone else for verification, testing, or audit purposes. With a clear __repr__() 
                    method, you can recreate the exact state of objects with ease.

## 3.3 - Operator overloading

    Built-in operator does not work on custom classes. For example, if we try to use "+" or any other operator such as
    "-", "*", "/", ">", ... this will raise a TypeError as the behavior for these operators are not implemented for the
    object. If we want to use built-in operator for custom objects we need to use dunder methods.
    The only exception is the "=" operator. If we don't implement the dunder method to specify the behavior of the
    equal operator for custom objects, python will check for object identity (i.e., both objects are the
    same instance). Thus even though each attributes of 2 objects are equal the "=" will return false

    Implementing dunder methods referring to built-in operator is called operator overloading.

## 3.4 - Attribute Management

    In Python, accessing and modifying object attributes can be customized using dunder methods.
    This allows controlling the reading, writing, or deletion of attributes that are not directly defined in the class, 
    or intercepting their manipulation.
    
    **Definition/Concept**:
    The methods `__getattr__`, `__setattr__`, and `__delattr__` are used to dynamically manage object attributes.
    
    **Why**:
    They allow intercepting access to attributes, adding custom logic when writing or deleting attributes, and making
    objects more robust against errors or more flexible (for example, for *dynamic binding*).
    
    ***When to use attribute management***:
        - When you want to intercept access to non-existent attributes
        - When you want to apply rules or validations while assigning attributes
        - When you want to handle the deletion of attributes in a controlled way
    

### Example: using `__getattr__`, `__setattr__`, and `__delattr__`

* `__getattr__(self, name)` : called only when a non-existent attribute is accessed.
* `__setattr__(self, name, value)` : called whenever an attribute is assigned.
* `__delattr__(self, name)` : called whenever an attribute is deleted.

## List comprehension

**Definition/Concept**
    List comprehension is a concise way to create lists in Python. It consists of an expression followed by a `for`
    loop inside square brackets `[]` or '{}. This allows you to generate a new list / dict by applying an expression to 
    each item in an existing list (or other iterable).

    Syntax:     [expression for item in iterable if condition] for creating a list
                {expression which generate a dict for item in iterable if condition} for creating a dict

**Why to use it**
1. **Conciseness:** List comprehensions can make your code more compact and easier to read by reducing the number
                    of lines of code.
2. **Readability:** When used appropriately, list comprehensions can make your intention clear, emphasizing the
                    transformation or filtering of data.
3. **Performance:** In some cases, using list comprehension can be faster than equivalent loops due to internal
                    optimizations in Python.

**When to use it**
1. **Simple Transformations:** When you want to apply a simple transformation to each element in a sequence.
                                For instance, squaring each number in a list or converting each string in a list to
                                uppercase.
2. **Filtering:** When you want to select only certain items from an iterable based on some condition.
                  For example, getting only the even numbers from a list.
3. **Flattening:** When dealing with lists of lists or nested iterables and you want to flatten them.
                    For example, flattening a 2D matrix into a 1D list.

4. **Avoid Overcomplication:** While list comprehensions are powerful, they shouldn't be overused.
                                If the logic becomes too complex, it might be clearer to use traditional loops instead
                                to maintain readability.

It's essential to strike a balance. If a list comprehension becomes hard to read or understand, it might be better
to revert to a more traditional for-loop structure.
