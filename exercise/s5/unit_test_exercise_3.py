EXERCISE 3 — Validate a Monte Carlo pricer against Black–Scholes

Task:

2) Write tests that:
   - For (S=100,K=100,r=0.05,σ=0.15,T=1year / 252 days) ≈ 8.59 for call and 3.71 for put
   - Check MC estimate is close to values above (0.1 error margin)
   - Check MC estimate vs Black-Scholes is roughly equals (0.1 error margin)

use the class previously implemented for BS and MC option pricing
